<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I've spent my entire professional career in Information Technology, moving through roles from Help Desk to Network Cable Installation and Inventory Manager. Lately, I’ve realized that in my last few jobs, I tended to follow a familiar pattern: I’d jump in, learn the ropes quickly, and then find myself spending my free time creating solutions on "How to make my job easier."</p><p>What started with Excel and VBA has evolved into a deeper dive into Python and SQL. Coding and data analysis wasn’t a requirement in my previous positions, it was regarded as a plus if you could do it, but that was it.</p><p>So, I've decided to take a big step in a different direction and embrace my passion for coding and analysis!</p></div>

<h3>Cool Stuff</h3>
<p>If there's one thing that I've learned from coding/dev, it's - "don't reinvent the wheel". Maybe one day I'll create something as cool as the weel, but for the time being, I like to embrace wheels, toys, and other cool things created by our awesome community. Below, are some of the things that either: saves me a great deal of time daily, or is just plain cool! If you like them, make sure to give the developer a thumbs up👍⭐!</p></div>
